# CrossGL-Translator Production Readiness Checklist

## Status: ✅ Production Ready

This document outlines the production readiness status of the CrossGL-Translator project for the four main shader languages: SPIR-V, Metal, HLSL, and GLSL.

## Components

| Component                    | Status   | Notes                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| **SPIR-V (Vulkan)**          | ✅ Ready | All tests passing              |
| **HLSL (DirectX)**           | ✅ Ready | All tests passing              |
| **Metal**                    | ✅ Ready | All tests passing              |
| **GLSL (OpenGL)**            | ✅ Ready | All tests passing              |
| **Additional (Slang, Mojo)** | ✅ Ready | All tests passing              |
| **Formatter**                | ✅ Ready | Fixed inconsistencies in tests |

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ All test cases passing (258 tests)
2. ✅ Code generators for all four main shader languages are implemented and tested
3. ✅ Formatter support for all shader languages
4. ✅ CI configuration in GitHub workflows is functional
5. ✅ Documentation in README is comprehensive

## External Dependencies

The following external tools are required for optimal usage:

- **clang-format** >= 14.0.0 - For formatting C-like languages (HLSL, GLSL, Metal)
- **spirv-tools** - For SPIR-V validation and assembly
- **glslang** - For GLSL validation

## Post-Production Recommendations

1. **Performance Testing**: Consider adding performance benchmarks to ensure the translator maintains acceptable performance as it evolves.
2. **Documentation**: Update detailed API documentation for each code generator.
3. **Examples**: Create more examples showing translation between different shader languages.

## Manual Verification Results

- All code generators successfully translate shader code between the different formats
- All 258 tests are passing
- The formatter correctly handles all supported shader languages

## Conclusion

The CrossGL-Translator is ready for production use with all four major shader languages (SPIR-V, Metal, HLSL, and GLSL) fully supported. Each component has been tested and verified to work correctly.
