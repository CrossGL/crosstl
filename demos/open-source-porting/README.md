# Open-Source Project Porting Demo

This directory contains small, pinned repository slices that exercise the
project translation pipeline against real open-source shader and GPU sources.
The cases are intentionally source-focused: CrossTL translates shader or kernel
artifacts, records reports, and leaves host runtime integration, resource
binding, and build-system migration as manual follow-up work.

## Running the demo

Regenerate every case in a temporary copy and compare the generated artifacts
with the checked-in references:

```bash
python demos/open-source-porting/run_demo.py --check
```

Refresh the checked-in reference artifacts after an intentional translator
change:

```bash
python demos/open-source-porting/run_demo.py --update
```

Run a platform-target subset with validation toolchain smoke checks:

```bash
python demos/open-source-porting/run_demo.py \
  --check \
  --run-toolchains \
  --require-toolchain-runs \
  --case directx-graphics-samples-hello-triangle \
  --target opengl \
  --target vulkan
```

The demo workflow in `.github/workflows/demo.yml` runs the reproducibility
check on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It also runs target-specific smoke checks:
OpenGL and Vulkan on Linux, Metal on macOS, and DirectX on Windows.

## Demo cases

| Case | Upstream | License | Source backend | Checked targets | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `directx-graphics-samples-hello-triangle` | `microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples` at `31ae3c91160d8634264004cdaf4e41a99c41243e` | MIT | DirectX/HLSL | CrossGL, OpenGL, Metal, DirectX, Vulkan | Uses the upstream Hello Triangle shader file without source edits. |
| `vulkan-samples-dynamic-line-grid` | `KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples` at `ab1e93d4a5dadf4c804fb6abbbe0b27dfa912b5a` | Apache-2.0 | GLSL | CrossGL, Metal, DirectX, Vulkan | Uses the reduced fragment shader already covered by backend fixture provenance. OpenGL smoke validation for this case is tracked in issue #745. |
| `apple-modern-rendering-mesh-viewdir` | `donaldwuid/apple_metal_sample_code` at `0bc50e5b3670b3169855ab260e8da5ff07b53749` | MIT | Metal | CrossGL, Metal, DirectX, Vulkan | Uses a reduced shader slice that keeps the relevant vertex-stage type conversion. OpenGL output is tracked in issue #746. |
| `metal-performance-testing-matmul` | `bkvogel/metal_performance_testing` at `b467b4b1dee0f7d9d43bda13856306ca3f1baea5` | BSD-style | Metal | CrossGL, Metal, Vulkan | Uses the upstream Metal kernel and its shared parameter header. The DirectX compute dispatch conversion is tracked in issue #744. |

## Source adjustments

The DirectX and Metal performance cases keep upstream source files unchanged.
The Vulkan and Apple cases are reduced source slices copied from fixture-backed
upstream examples so the demo remains small and deterministic. The reductions
remove unrelated code around the shader construct being demonstrated; they do
not patch translator output.

The complete `lonelydevil/vulkan-tutorial-C-implementation` shader pair was
tested as a candidate and exposed an artifact path collision when `shader.vert`
and `shader.frag` are translated together. That translator issue is tracked in
issue #743, and the case is intentionally not checked in until project artifact
mapping preserves distinct stage files.

## Generated artifacts

Each case stores reference artifacts under `crosstl-out/`. Portability reports
are not committed because they include machine-local absolute project roots.
The demo runner and CI workflow generate fresh reports for every run and can
write them to a separate reports directory for inspection. The runner disables
optional code formatting during generation so artifact comparisons do not
depend on host `clang-format` availability.

## Third-party notices

The source slices remain under their upstream project licenses. See
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for repository, license, and source URL details.
